    <i>History of the car <strong>Skoda Octavia</strong></i>
</h1>
<p>
    The <strong> Škoda Octavia </strong> is a small family car produced by the Czech car manufacturer Škoda Auto since
    the end of 1996. It
    shares its name with an earlier model produced between 1959 and 1971. Four generations of the modern-era Octavia
    model have been introduced to date, delivered with five-door liftback saloon or five-door estate styles only. The
    car is front engined, both front- or four-wheel drive are offered. Around five million units have been sold in its
    two decades of presence on the market.[2] The Octavia is Škoda's most popular model; about 40% of all newly
    manufactured Škoda cars are Octavias.
