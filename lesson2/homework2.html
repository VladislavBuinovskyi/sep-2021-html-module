<p class="low">Felidae is a <strong>family</strong> of mammals in the order Carnivora, colloquially referred to as cats,
    and constitutes
    a clade. A member of this family is also called a felid (/ˈfiːlɪd/).[4][5][6][7] The term "cat" refers both to
    felids in general and specifically to the domestic cat (Felis catus).[8]

    Felidae species exhibit the most diverse fur pattern of all terrestrial carnivores.[9] Cats have retractile claws,
    slender muscular bodies and strong flexible forelimbs. Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite.
    They are all obligate carnivores, and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey. Wild cats occur
    in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest habitats, some to arid
    environments, and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain. Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and
    crepuscular to diurnal, depending on their preferred prey species.[10]

    Reginald Innes Pocock divided the extant Felidae into three subfamilies: the Pantherinae, the Felinae and the
    Acinonychinae, differing from each other by the ossification of the hyoid apparatus and by the cutaneous sheaths
    which protect their claws.[11] This concept has been revised following developments in molecular biology and
    techniques for analysis of morphological data. Today, the living Felidae are divided in two subfamilies: the
    Pantherinae and Felinae, with the Acinonychinae subsumed into the latter. Pantherinae includes five Panthera and two
    Neofelis species, while Felinae includes the other 34 species in ten genera.[12]

    The first cats emerged during the Oligocene about 25 million years ago, with the appearance of Proailurus and
    Pseudaelurus. The latter species complex was ancestral to two main lines of felids: the cats in the extant
    subfamilies and a group of extinct cats of the subfamily Machairodontinae, which include the saber-toothed cats such
    as the Smilodon. The "false sabre-toothed cats", the Barbourofelidae and Nimravidae, are not true cats, but are
    closely related. Together with the Felidae, Viverridae, hyaenas and mongooses, they constitute the Feliformia.

<h2>Cougar</h2>
<p class="momo">The cougar (Puma concolor) is a large cat of the subfamily Felinae. Native to the Americas, its range spans from the
    Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes in South America and is the most widespread of any large wild terrestrial
    mammal in the Western Hemisphere. It is an adaptable, generalist species, occurring in most American habitat types.
    Due to its wide range, it has many names, including puma, mountain lion, catamount, panther and painter.

    The cougar is the second-largest cat in the New World after the jaguar (Panthera onca). Secretive and largely
    solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do
    occur. Despite its size, the cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (Felis
    catus) than to any species of the subfamily Pantherinae.
